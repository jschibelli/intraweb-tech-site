      <h2 id="client-services">Client Services</h2>

      <h3>Service Agreements</h3>
      <p>
        Engagement of our consulting services requires execution of a separate service agreement that specifies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scope of services</li>
        <li>Deliverables and timelines</li>
        <li>Fees and payment terms</li>
        <li>Confidentiality obligations</li>
        <li>Termination provisions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These Terms apply in addition to any service agreement. In the event of a conflict, the service agreement governs for matters related to the specific engagement.
      </p>

      <h3>Diagnostic Services</h3>
      <p>
        Our Agent Readiness Diagnostic is a fixed-scope, fixed-price engagement. The diagnostic fee is due in full upon execution of the service agreement. Diagnostic services are non-refundable once work has commenced.
      </p>

      <h3>Retainer Services</h3>
      <p>
        Implementation retainer services are billed monthly in advance. The minimum engagement term is six months. Following the initial term, services continue month-to-month and may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.
      </p>

      <h3>Client Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        Successful delivery of our services requires your cooperation and timely provision of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to relevant systems, personnel, and documentation</li>
        <li>Prompt responses to requests for information</li>
        <li>Feedback on deliverables within agreed timeframes</li>
        <li>Designated point of contact with decision-making authority</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Delays caused by failure to meet these responsibilities may affect project timelines and are not the responsibility of IntraWeb.
      </p>

      <h2 id="fees-and-payment">Fees and Payment</h2>

      </p>
