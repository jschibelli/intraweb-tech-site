    "question": "What is the diagnostic?",
    "answer": "The diagnostic is a 2 to 3 week engagement where we review your current workflows, identify automation opportunities, and deliver a prioritized implementation roadmap. It is a standalone service with no required long-term commitment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does implementation take?",
    "answer": "Implementation runs on a 6 month minimum retainer after the diagnostic. Final scope and timeline depend on roadmap priorities, existing systems, and integration complexity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is IntraWeb right for?",
    "answer": "IntraWeb is designed for operations-focused SMBs, typically with 20 to 150 employees, that need help implementing AI and workflow automation in day-to-day operations. It is generally not the right fit for one-time projects, chatbot-only requests, or very small teams."
  },
  {
    "question": "What sets you apart from consultants or dev shops?",
    "answer": "IntraWeb focuses on implementation and operational rollout, not only strategy recommendations. The engagement includes workflow build, deployment, and iteration based on measurable business outcomes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I get started?",
    "answer": "Submit a request through the contact form to schedule a diagnostic call. We typically respond within one business day and confirm whether the engagement is a good fit."
  }
