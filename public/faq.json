    "question": "How do we start?",
    "answer": "We start every engagement with a paid diagnostic—a structured assessment of your workflows, bottlenecks, and automation opportunities. You get a written roadmap that prioritizes what's actually worth fixing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after the diagnostic?",
    "answer": "You decide whether to move forward with implementation. No pressure. No sales theater. Just clarity on what the work would look like and what it would solve."
  },
  {
    "question": "What makes your approach different?",
    "answer": "We don't hand you a report and walk away. We embed with your team, redesign workflows, and implement automation that actually gets used. We stay engaged long enough to make changes stick."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long do engagements typically last?",
    "answer": "Engagements stay predictable, bounded, and tied to outcomes—not billable hours or feature creep. The diagnostic defines scope, implementation is incremental, and ongoing partnership is structured."
  },
  {
    "question": "Ready to start?",
    "answer": "If you're dealing with coordination drag, informal workflows, or operational friction slowing your organization down, email us at contact@intrawebtech.com to request a diagnostic."
