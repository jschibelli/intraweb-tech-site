  {
    "question": "What is the diagnostic?",
    "answer": "A 2–3 week engagement where we map your workflows, identify where automation makes sense, and build a prioritized roadmap. You'll know exactly where automation will drive savings—and have a plan to act on. No commitment to ongoing work."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does implementation take?",
    "answer": "We work on a 6-month minimum retainer after the diagnostic. Scope is defined by diagnostic findings. We build and deploy workflows—agent integrations, automation sequences, exception handling—hands-on, not advisory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is IntraWeb right for?",
    "answer": "Operations-heavy SMBs (20–150 employees) with complex internal workflows, already using AI tools but not seeing returns, or operations leaders dealing with coordination overhead. We're not a fit for one-time projects, chatbot-only needs, or very small teams under 20."
  },
  {
    "question": "What sets you apart from consultants or dev shops?",
    "answer": "We're the implementation layer between your AI tools and your P&L. We stick around until it works—hands-on workflow build and deployment, tool-agnostic and outcome-focused. We don't stop at recommendations or build without understanding operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I get started?",
    "answer": "Request a diagnostic call via our contact form. We'll respond within 1 business day to schedule. No pitch, no pressure—we'll tell you if we're not the right fit to implement."
